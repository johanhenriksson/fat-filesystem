push the changes bacK to stash. Stash records who is responsible for
the various commits, it is therefore very important that each of you
submit this form from your own account.

assignment submission process. If you make changes after submitting
this file then you should make a minor change to the file, such as
adding a comment in the Acknowledgement section and then resubmit the
file. If working in pairs both of you must do this.
